Unity DM Helper
===========================================

A small app created in 10 days using the Unity game engine, to help my players visualize combats in DnD sessions. Served as a first experiment on Unity before moving to a more "fleshed out" project.

Builds as-is for all platforms, provided you have a minimum resolution of 2560x1800 - the project was only meant to run on a Pixel C.

Feel free to fork / build from this repo, submit pull requests, or use this as a starting point for Unity projects of your own.
